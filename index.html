    <h2>About Mary Cassatt</h2>
    <div class="image-placeholder">[Insert Portrait of Mary Cassatt Here]</div>
    <p>
      Mary Cassatt (1844–1926) was an American painter and printmaker best known for her role in the Impressionist movement in France. As one of the few female artists to exhibit alongside the likes of Edgar Degas and Claude Monet, Cassatt developed a distinct visual language centered on the domestic lives and emotional worlds of women and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and later in Paris, Cassatt forged a path that challenged gendered expectations in both the American and European art worlds. Her works are characterized by technical finesse and psychological depth, often blending the intimacy of subject matter with bold compositional innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond her artistic achievements, Cassatt maintained an active intellectual life and sustained correspondences with family and peers. These letters offer invaluable insights into her personal beliefs, aesthetic positions, and the transatlantic cultural dynamics of her time.

    <p>
      The letters presented in this edition are drawn from the Mary Cassatt papers, held by the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. The collection contains a rich array of correspondence written by Cassatt primarily to her family, particularly her nephew Albert Dakin Gihon. These letters span topics such as art exhibitions, professional challenges, personal opinions on the art market, and her reflections on European cultural life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their tone and content, the letters reveal Cassatt’s sharp intellect, wit, and occasionally candid critiques of the art world. The selection in this digital edition has been transcribed, encoded using the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) guidelines, and linked to external data using RDF to support enhanced exploration, contextualization, and research.
    </p>
