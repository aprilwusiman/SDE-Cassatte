    <h2>About Mary Cassatt</h2>
    <div class="image-placeholder"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aprilwusiman/SDE-Cassatte/refs/heads/main/Mary-Cassatt-Lydia-Seated-in-the-Garden-with-a-Dog-in-Her-Lap.jpg" alt="Mary Cassatt - Lydia Seated in the Garden with a Dog in Her Lap" /></div>
    <p>
      Mary Cassatt (1844–1926) was an American painter and printmaker best known for her role in the Impressionist movement in France. As one of the few female artists to exhibit alongside the likes of Edgar Degas and Claude Monet, Cassatt developed a distinct visual language centered on the domestic lives and emotional worlds of women and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and later in Paris, Cassatt forged a path that challenged gendered expectations in both the American and European art worlds. Her works are characterized by technical finesse and psychological depth, often blending the intimacy of subject matter with bold compositional innovation.
